A database is a collection of organized data.
Database is of 2 types:-
1. SQL - data is stored in tables. 
         mainly used when there is a lot of relational data.
         Fast but difficult to scale.
         Vertically scalable.

2. NoSQL - data is not stored in table format
           most popular - json objects
           tables -> collections
           tuples -> documents
           Eg. a collection of students in the school database will have different json objects each representing one student
           Horizontally scalable.

Firestore is a nosql database.

Every document in a collection has a unique ID.
