firebase - self managed and self hosted backend service provided by Google so that we do not have to invest time in building the backend from scratch.
can be used for android, ios applications, web applications.

A database is a collection of organized data.
Database is of 2 types:-
1. SQL - data is stored in tables. 
         mainly used when there is a lot of relational data.
         Fast but difficult to scale.
         Vertically scalable.

2. NoSQL - data is not stored in table format
           most popular - json objects
           tables -> collections
           tuples -> documents
           Eg. a collection of students in the school database will have different json objects each representing one student
           Horizontally scalable.
           Data is dumped and not stored in an order.

Firestore is a nosql database.
indexing - index is assigned to all the documents for faster searching and querying operations.
Firebase compulsorily asks for indexing when applying sorting to the db.

Every document in a collection has a unique ID.

The get() method of firestore db returns a querySnapshot object.
